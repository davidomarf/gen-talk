Over the last one and a half years, I've been having a lot of dispersed ideas about generative art.

This article was written to synthesize those ideas into a single, coherent, robust,
and extensive work.

This text provides most of the content I'll use in talks about generative art, so
I'll always reference it for those who are interested in reviewing it at their own pace, without
having to look or listen to my dumb face and voice.

## Art

Across time, there have been several theories and definitions of art. But so far, not a single one
has been universally accepted, and most likely will never be.

I believe in the theory that humans evolved an _art instinct_ as a result of sexual
selection, prompting aesthetic evolution in humans.

After that premise, I trust that my gut is enough to decide if something is art (although not enough
to decide if something **is not art**).

If I find a work aesthetically pleasing, and I consider it art, it is. Same for you.

## Generative

This is the word used to define something capable of production, or reproduction, via a set of
rules.

There is generative grammar, which uses a set of rules to generate grammatically correct sentences. Or
generative programming, in which a compiler allows the programmer to write at a higher level of
abstraction.

Mathematically, a generative system is one that uses just a few basic rules to yield patterns that can be
extremely varied and unpredictable.

## Generative Art

Generative art is the beautiful and interesting result of mixing generative systems and art.

A piece of generative art is a work that was fully or partially produced by the assistance of a generative
process.

The history of generative art is well documented. It is considered to have begun in 1965 when Nees Georg and
Frieder Nake shared their work.

There are a lot of types of generative art: music, visual art, software art, architecture, literature.

Generative tools can be digital or analogical.

_Musikalisches WÃ¼rfelspiel_ (musical dice game) is the term used to refer to the system that uses dices to
randomly generate music from precomposed options, and there are two supposed Mozart compositions under this
method.

However, for the rest of this post, I'll be focusing on algorithmic visual images.

## How to start

As noted previously, the following section will help you develop a mindset to get into generative art,
but they are meant to be a guide to produce digital images. Nonetheless, they will serve as a general
outline to every type of generative art, and can be extrapolated by getting the mindset, not the specific
instructions.

### Knowing the tools

You have two kinds of tools available to you:

- **Representation tools**: the elements you use to visualize the data in the screen.
- **Generation tools**: common approaches to design the algorithms that generate the data. These are

#### Representation tools

The most basic concept you need to get familiar with is the cartesian plane.

In the screen, each coordinate represents a pixel. The coordinate (0, 0) is in the top left corner, with
the x-axis running from left to right, and the y-axis from top to bottom.

- You'll mostly work with the cartesian plane. It could be alternatives to it, but not that I know about.
  And when you work with the cartesian plane, you need to know your coordinates. At least x and y.
- With coordinates, you can produce points.
- By joining points, you can produce lines.
- You can perturbate lines using extra points to produce curves.
  - Beizer curves.

#### Generation tools (algorithms)

- Recursion
- Particle Interaction
- Genetic rules
- Equation base algorithms
- Cellular automata

### Setting up a framework

You need a programming/scripting language and a library to produce graphics.

There are a lot of alternatives, but the most common one is using
[Processing](https://processing.org/), a programming language built "to learn how to code
in the context of visual arts".

Its community is really big, and you'll find a lot of resources and help online.
It's probably the safest route. 

The same team behind Processing developed P5.js, a JavaScript library with the same goal.

I use P5.js, and I think I'd use it again if I were to start again from the beginning.

To set up a framework with P5.js, you only need a text editor, the library files (which you can
download or import from a CDN), and a web browser.

Benjamin Kovach has written about his stack in 
[Generating artwork with Haskell](https://www.kovach.me/posts/2018-03-07-generating-art.html), using
Cairo as the graphics library.

Tyler Hobbs wrote [Using Quil for Artwork](https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2015/using-quil-for-artwork),
which is a Clojure library.

Anders Hoff developed _snek_ in Common Lisp: [SNEK is not an acronym](https://inconvergent.net/2017/snek-is-not-an-acronym/).

## Quick code examples

(Include some examples of code with their own result, using some of the methods
and tools listed before, with a walkthrough)

## Tips

There are a some things that I currently do, that I wish I had started doing them way before.
This would be the answer to the question "What would yo do if you were to start again from
the beginning?"

- **Using seeds**
  : Seeds for the random or noise functions will make those functions deterministic by always
  returning the same values. This will let you see more easily how a single change in the code
  affects the final image, without you having to distinguish them between two completely different
  works.

- **Embracing the mistakes**
  : If you have a good idea and when implementing it, you find it's a faulty implementation, don't
  try to stick with the original idea at all costs. Sometimes branching ideas is a good decision.

- **Perfect is the enemy of done**
  : Don't keep improving an idea that you've already spent too much time on, if those improvements
  aren't great. Just consider it finished for now, and move to a new project. This will keep the
  inertia

- **Be prolific, not a genius**
  : Related with the last one, don't try to produce a single perfect piece of art. Seek quantity.
  I know it may sound wrong. But by doing a lot of works you'll practice, you'll learn, and you'll
  become more variated. The odds of producing one great work is bigger if you have a lot of works.

## Further

This article was only focused in producing digital images, but the principles
about knowing your basic tools, and the methods to abstract and produce ideas,
are still valid in other types of generative art:
