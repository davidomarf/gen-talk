# gen-talk

Personal repository to get things ready for a generative art talk focused on visual graphics

## to-do

- Code a pixelsort variant.

## Scope of the talk

Show what generative art is, and how anyone can get into it by knowing some basic stuff to start.

## Pre-research

- What is gen-art
- A little bit of history of the field.
  - Main names and characters
- How to apply some rules to the process
- My particular case
  - How I knew about it
  - How I got into it
  - Talk about my proccess / Show and explain some of my works
- Where to find inspiration
- Where to see my works

## Research part

### Definition

    Refers to any practice where the artist uses a system, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomy, contributing to, or resulting in a completed work of art.

## Ideas for interaction

- Code a pixel-sort work that will create art out of a picture from the room of the talk.
-

## Further ideas

- Mixing highly ordered and highly desordered systems in a single work.
